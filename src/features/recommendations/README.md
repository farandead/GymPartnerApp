# Recommendations Feature

## Overview
The recommendations module implements machine learning-based match suggestions based on user interests, behaviors, and similarities.

## Implementation Requirements

### Components
- `RecommendationCard`: Display recommended matches
- `SimilarityScore`: Show compatibility percentage
- `RecommendationReason`: Explain why a match is recommended
- `FeedbackButtons`: Collect feedback on recommendation quality

### Services
- `recommendationService`: Generate and deliver recommendations
- `userSimilarityService`: Calculate user compatibility
- `feedbackProcessingService`: Process recommendation feedback

### Screens
- `RecommendationsScreen`: View recommended matches
- `RecommendationDetailsScreen`: See why a match was recommended
- `FeedbackScreen`: Provide feedback on recommendation quality

### Types
- `Recommendation`: Recommendation data structure
- `SimilarityMetrics`: Compatibility measurements
- `RecommendationFeedback`: User feedback on recommendations

## ML Recommendation System
Implement a basic recommendation algorithm based on:
- Personality question similarities
- Workout preferences and history
- Location proximity (gym proximity)
- Activity level compatibility
- Music taste (Spotify integration)
- Previous successful matches (learning)

## Implementation Notes
- Start with rule-based recommendations initially
- Evolve to ML-based recommendations as data grows
- Consider user feedback for algorithm improvement
- Balance diversity with similarity in recommendations
- Explain recommendation reasons for transparency
- Consider collaborative filtering techniques
